# Vendor Sales & Profitability Analysis

**Project Type:** Data Analysis & Dashboarding  
**Tools & Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, SQL, Excel  
**Skills Demonstrated:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, Data Visualization, Dashboard Creation, Business Insights  

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor sales and inventory data to identify top and low-performing vendors, calculate unsold inventory value, and assess profit margins. Insights derived help make data-driven recommendations for improving profitability, optimizing inventory management, and enhancing vendor performance.

---

## Key Objectives
- Analyze vendor sales, purchase, and inventory data to calculate KPIs like **profit margin**, **unsold capital**, and **purchase contribution**.  
- Identify **top-performing** and **low-performing** vendors using sales thresholds.  
- Apply **statistical methods** (confidence intervals, t-tests) to validate differences in profit margins.  
- Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize vendor performance and purchase contribution.  
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations to optimize operations and improve profitability.

## Steps & Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Loaded vendor sales dataset (CSV/SQL).  
   - Filtered invalid records: removed entries with negative sales, zero profit margin, or missing values.  
   - Calculated derived columns such as **unsold capital**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summarized key metrics: total sales, total purchase, gross profit, profit margin.  
   - Visualized distributions using **histograms** and identified **outliers**.  
   - Segmented vendors into **top** and **low-performing** based on sales quantiles.

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculated **95% confidence intervals** for profit margins of top and low-performing vendors.  
   - Conducted **t-tests** to assess if profit margin differences were statistically significant.  
   - Derived insights such as lower-selling vendors often have higher profit margins, indicating premium pricing or lower operational costs.

4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Created interactive dashboards to display:
     - Total Sales, Purchases, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, Unsold Capital  
     - Top Vendors & Brands by Sales  
     - Purchase Contribution of top vendors  
     - Low-performing vendors and slow-moving inventory  
   - Used **card visuals, bar charts, donut charts, funnel charts, and scatter plots** to represent data clearly.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - **Top-performing vendors:** Explore selective price adjustments, cost optimization, and bundling strategies.  
   - **Low-performing vendors:** Improve marketing, optimize pricing, and enhance distribution.  
   - Optimize inventory by managing slow-moving stock and leveraging bulk purchasing benefits.  

---

## Key Findings
- **Low-performing vendors** often maintain higher profit margins (40–42%) compared to top-performing vendors (30–31%).  
- Significant difference in profit margins confirmed via **t-test**.  
- Identified **198 brands** with low sales but high profit margins, potential candidates for promotion or pricing adjustments.  
- Created **actionable insights** to boost sales without sacrificing profitability.
